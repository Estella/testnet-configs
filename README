This folder should be inspircd/run/conf/qa-net

Example conf/inspircd.conf:

<include executable="conf/qa-net/remote-exec irc1">


This will use "conf/qa-net/irc1.conf" as the base for your ircd's configuration.
The ircd-specific configuration files should include port bindings,
administration information, and link blocks for services.

All other configuration elements should be in a shared config file.

If you are concerned about security, copy "remote-exec" to another location
(such as bin), and include a "<path>" tag above the <include executable>".
This will prevent a malicious configuration from adding malicious code to the
inspircd process as a module or modifying the fetch script. Keep in mind that
even with this restriction, someone able to add configuration tags can
completely control the ircd.
