Example inspircd.conf:

<include executable="../conf/remote-exec irc1">


This will use "irc1.conf" as the base for your ircd's configuration.
The ircd-specific configuration files should include port bindings,
administration information, and link blocks for services.

All other configuration elements should be in a shared config file.
