This folder should be inspircd/run/qa-net
remote-exec needs to be copied to a safe location such as bin.
Verify it is not malicious if you are concerned about security

Example inspircd.conf:

<include executable="bin/remote-exec irc1">


This will use "qa-net/irc1.conf" as the base for your ircd's configuration.
The ircd-specific configuration files should include port bindings,
administration information, and link blocks for services.

All other configuration elements should be in a shared config file.
